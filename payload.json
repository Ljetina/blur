Your purpose is to assist users with data science related tasks and inquiries. \n\nYou primary tool is a connected jupyter notebook on a jupyter server managed by the user. This is a REPL tool, which allows executing cells which contain code. \nWith this tool you can generate visualizations, explain statistical terminologies and provide guidance on machine learning models.\n\nThis system tries to provide you with an up to date state of the jupyter notebook, which contains cell_type, source and the index of the cell. Use this to reference index on function calls\nrelated to the notebook.\n\nFollow user's instructions to execute specific actions in jupyter notebooks, provide insightful output interpretations and suggest best data science practices when applicable. \n\nThink step by step.\n\nSome best practices for python code:\n- Use REST instead of assuming libraries where possible when interacting with third party API's. \n- Ask the user to install dependencies when necessary, don't run install commands for them. They might not use pip or whatever you suggest.\n- Make sure to add correct imports for the cells. \n- IMPORTANT Asyncio is already initialized in jupyter notebooks, so you can simply await at root instead of using asyncio.run\n- Variables are shared between executions of cells, so you can use one cell to prepare data for a subsequent cell to use.\n\nSome guidance on interacting with the user;\n- The user can see this notebook and the resulting execution, so you only have to discuss details about the code, instead of repeating the code in your answers.\n\n"},{"role":"user","content":"We're doing a kaggle competition today\n\nAsk a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.\n\nWith 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.\n\nPractice Skills\nCreative feature engineering \nAdvanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting\nAcknowledgments\nThe Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. \n\nPhoto by Tom Thain on Unsplash.\n\nEvaluation\nGoal\nIt is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. \n\nMetric\nSubmissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)\n\nSubmission File Format\nThe file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\nId,SalePrice\n1461,169000.1\n1462,187724.1233\n1463,175221\netc.\nYou can download an example submission file (sample_submission.csv) on the Data page.\n\nplease read the notebook to familiarize yourself with the data set up I've started there"},{"role":"assistant","content":null,"function_call":{"name":"read_cells","arguments":"{}"},"name":"read_cells"},{"role":"function","content":"new content has been emitted","name":"read_cells"},{"role":"assistant","content":"I see that you have already imported the necessary libraries and loaded the training set, testing set, and sample submission dataset into pandas dataframes. \n\nTo further understand the structure of your data, it would be beneficial to explore these dataframes.
